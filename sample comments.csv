"Love the intuitive dashboard and real-time analytics—Power BI integration is seamless for my reports. Minor lag on mobile login, but overall 9/10 for daily use in my analytics workflow."
"UI is clean, but the comment submission form crashes on iOS Safari every third try. Sentiment analysis preview feature is genius for quick insights, though—fix the bugs and it's perfect."
"Great for team collaboration; sharing insights from user feedback summaries works flawlessly. Add dark mode and export to PDF options to make it enterprise-ready. Highly recommend!"
"Struggles with large comment batches (>500); processing times out after 2 minutes. Theme extraction is accurate, but needs better error handling and progress indicators."
"Transformed how I handle app reviews—sentiment trends over time are spot-on, and action item suggestions save hours. One request: multilingual support for global teams."
"Onboarding tutorial is too basic; assumes prior LLM knowledge. Core pipeline delivers solid summaries, but customize prompts per app type (e.g., e-commerce vs. SaaS). Solid 7/10."
"Exceptional value for Python/Dataiku users like me. Batched JSON outputs integrate perfectly into my workflows. Only nitpick: API rate limits hit during peak hours."
"Poor mobile responsiveness—charts don't render on Android. Desktop version excels at theme clustering, but needs responsive design overhaul for field teams."
"Insightful aggregations reveal user pain points I missed manually. Scheduling daily runs is a game-changer. Suggestion: Add anomaly detection for sentiment spikes."
"Reliable and scalable, but lacks advanced filtering (e.g., by user segment). Summaries are concise yet detailed—pair it with Power BI for killer dashboards. 8.5/10.
